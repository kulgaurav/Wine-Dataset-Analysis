									<p><strong>Background of research:</strong></p>
<p>Recent studies show that notifications triggered on our mobile devices at inappropriate times can cause interruptions in the ongoing task by diverting our attention, which potentially delays the task completion, including an increased rate of error. These notifications can come from any of the app installed on our phone like news app, social media apps, games, and others.</p>
<p>Based on our response to the notification either read and respond or clear, we want to develop a Machine Learning based solution to understand our response to the notification during different times of the day like morning, working hours, night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are invited to participate in this study of the Intelligent Notification System, which aims to improve the experience with push-based notifications on mobile phones. This study will use the notification related data and engagement with it to build machine learning models, which will help the notification system to learn the appropriate time to notify the user.</p>
<p>This study is being carried out as part of the requirements for an M.Sc. in Computer Science (Data Science) at Trinity College Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures of the study:</strong></p>
<p><em>We would like android phone users (&gt;18ys old) to help us by being part of our study.</em></p>
<p>You will be asked to install an android app on your phone, which will run in the background to collect/log the interaction with notifications delivered to your phone. Once the application is installed, a consent form will appear in the first run and will ask for permission to collect data. When approval is granted, then only the application will run else, it will be closed. Any notification data won&rsquo;t be collected if the user has denied permission.</p>
<p>The following notification details will be collected as a part of the study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notification Timestamp&nbsp;</li>
<li>Notification Posted or Removed</li>
<li>Unique Notification Id generated by Android</li>
<li>Current user activity</li>
<li>GPS Location (Optional)</li>
<li>Phone locked or unlocked</li>
<li>Silent mode or ringer mode</li>
<li>Vibration mode</li>
<li>Internet connectivity/bandwidth</li>
<li>Battery Level</li>
<li>Gender (Optional)</li>
<li>Age (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>We expect the experiment to run for around 30 days. After that you will be notified to uninstall the application.</p>
<p>We collect GPS data as users prefer to attend a notification at some locations than others. GPS data will be analyzed only from a numeric perspective (radius), and not related to any data sources giving a semantic interpretation of locations. The location data collection is optional and requires additional permission from the volunteer. The study will not involve any analysis of geolocation data except to identify the relative distance between two points where you interacted with the notifications.</p>
<p>We use Activity Recognition API from google to identify the current user activity. We get one of the values from the API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still</li>
<li>On foot</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>In a vehicle</li>
<li>On a bicycle</li>
<li>Tilting</li>
<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities can help understand the interaction with notifications on the mobile device during various user movements.</p>
<p>We do not anticipate any risks to participants as the study will not involve collection of any</p>
<p>sensitive information beyond the numeric location data, which will not be related to any data sources giving interpretation of locations. While participation will not benefit the participants directly, the research will support the development of smart tools for notification management which will benefit the mobile phone users.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to my data and how can I withdraw?</strong></p>
<p>Data will be stored securely on the Google Cloud Platform that maintains high-level security models and protocols for data centers as well as server stacks. More information and details available at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/overview/">https://cloud.google.com/security/overview/</a>.</p>
<p>Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any point before the completion of data collection. Once the experiment completes, the collected data will be anonymized as per the GDPR. The participants need to inform the researcher via email with email id (used to sign up with) indicating that you wish to withdraw from the Intelligent Notification System study and can uninstall the application from her/his phone. Based on the email request, the researcher will delete the respective user's data from the database.</p>
<p>Once the data is anonymized on experiment completion, there is no way to identify the user based on the data gathered, so data deletion requests for specific users won't be possible.</p>
<p>In line with TCD guidelines on good research practice, data will be retained for research integrity purposes for five years in an encrypted format.</p>
<p><strong>Debriefing arrangements:</strong></p>
<p>Participants can always see the data collected by installed application as part of the study in two modes, the last data collected and previously saved all the data at the application console.</p>
<p>We will publish free-to-access copies of all publications on this project. You can also ask for the final report to all releases and codes by emailing us.</p>
<p>The research results will be published in an M.Sc. dissertation at Trinity College Dublin.</p>
<p>While it is unlikely that illicit activities would be disclosed, if you do so, we would be obliged to report them to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>If you have any queries, feel free to contact Kul Gaurav &lt;gauravk@tcd.ie&gt;, and we will be happy to answer questions about the experiment.</p>
